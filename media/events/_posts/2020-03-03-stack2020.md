## Update: STACK 2020 is postponed! ##

STACK will be postponed to 1-3 December 2020, in light of the recent COVID-19 developments in Singapore.

We thank all for the strong support thus far, and look forward to bringing the STACK community together later this year.

STACK is GovTechâ€™s flagship conference and the largest government-led developers event in Singapore that connects government, industry and the tech community.

Registration will reopen in the later half of the year, so do look out for it and hope to see you at STACK 2020! For more information, please visit [https://www.govtechstack.sg](https://www.govtechstack.sg)
