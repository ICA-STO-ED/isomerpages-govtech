Digital services such as Moments of Life and the GoBusiness portal are helping the community adapt to a new way of life.

When the Government announced the mandatory shift to full home-based learning for schools and institutes of higher learning on April 8, students and teachers had to adapt swiftly to new methods of learning with technology. 
 
Mr Morier Adam, 19, a second-year biomedical science student at Republic Polytechnic (RP), went from attending classroom discussions and interactive seminars to online lessons at home via LEO2.0 — a learning management system for self-directed learning that will soon be further enhanced with cloud-hosted capabilities.

Introduced by the polytechnic in 2017, the custom-built system lets students access online learning content — such as videos, quizzes and discussion forums — collaborate with classmates and submit assignments with their laptops and mobile devices. 

Mr Adam is among 13,000 students and lecturers at RP who were able to use the online portal to keep up with the school curriculum. 

While convenient, Mr Adam says that learning from home is different in that being on campus allows plenty of social interaction throughout the day.

“It’s so much easier for discussions as compared to doing it online where only one person can talk at a time. Conversations don’t happen as fast and so collaborating is definitely challenging,” he says.

But he stresses that the transition to home-based learning was seamless as he has been using the portal since he started at the polytechnic. 

“As LEO2.0 was already implemented before Covid-19, it has been very helpful during this pandemic. It made it easy for us to adapt to digital learning,” he says.

### **Smart Nation push in a pandemic**

Such nimble responses to the Covid-19 crisis have underscored the importance of Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, which focuses on harnessing technology to improve lives and livelihoods and stay ahead as a global city.

At a time when lifestyle habits are drastically altered and economic activity disrupted, technology and innovation have been crucial to help citizens and businesses adjust to new norms.

When Madam Crystal Chew, 29, gave birth to her first child in February, she was worried about the amount of paperwork and travelling she would have to do to register her son’s birth at the hospital and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority building. 

Her fears were eased when staff at Thomson Medical Centre told her about [Moments of Life](https://www.life.gov.sg/) (MOL), a one-stop mobile platform that provides a suite of government services to support citizens’ needs at various milestones.  

Key features of the mobile application, which was developed for young parents and the elderly include electronic application for birth registration, online access to the child’s immunisation records and access to information on government schemes and benefits. 

Through the app, Madam Chew was able to register her newborn’s birth from the comfort of her home a few days after being discharged. She added that the app interface made it easy to use. 

“I liked that I did not have to rush to do the registration during my stay in the hospital.”

With MOL, the amount of time spent on personal application processes can be whittled down significantly.

At the Committee of Supply (COS) debate this year, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-In-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, said the app reduces a parent’s waiting time during the birth registration process from an hour to a mere 15 minutes. 

The app now includes a Family Support Calculator for families with children below six years old to find out more about the subsidies, parental leave schemes, benefits and grants which they are eligible for. Furthermore, families can use MOL to search for pre-schools and – in an upcoming pilot trial with NTUC First Campus – allow them to conduct pre-school registrations. 

Dr Balakrishnan added that the MOL app, developed by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), will be enhanced later this year to provide more Singaporeans with access to simpler government services. 

According to GovTech, these services will include those related to job hunting, tax management and travel information of Singaporeans living here and abroad.

Since its launch in 2018, the app has been downloaded by more than 150,000 users and used to register six in 10 newborns at both government and private hospitals.

### **Back in business**

Aside from improving the lives of citizens, the Government’s Smart Nation initiative also supports businesses in Singapore.

Last October, the Government launched the [GoBusiness](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences) portal to help business owners with one of the most challenging aspects of starting operations — applying for licences. 

Developed by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office, GovTech and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the portal streamlines regulatory requirements and digitalises transactions between the Government and businesses. It fosters a pro-enterprise environment.

At the COS debate, Dr Balakrishnan cited the “extremely onerous process” that food and beverage (F&B) businesses must go through to apply for the right licences. These enterprises have as many as 14 different licences to apply for and over 800 form fields to fill out. 

To ease complex application processes, GoBusiness offers a “Guided Journey” feature for F&B businesses that provides a four-step process to help users identify the licences they need and which agency they need to approach to get their business up and running.
 
As of January, over 460 food and beverage establishments were able to secure the necessary licences quickly and easily through the portal. 

On average, users see a reduction of 10 to 14 days for licence applications.

To support businesses as Singapore exits the circuit breaker period, the Government rolled out an additional platform called [Covid GoBusiness](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/).

The platform provides businesses with useful information such as the list of permitted services allowed to resume operations, applications for exemptions, safe management measures and guidelines, and a list of government support schemes that businesses can apply for during this period. 

Mr Daniel Chan, deputy director of GoBusiness at GovTech, explained that the portal plays a crucial role in guiding companies as they navigate rough waters amid the Covid-19 situation.

GoBusiness now caters mostly to F&B businesses but will be expanded to include more industry sectors. GovTech will also enhance the platform to provide more assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises, and launch an e-advisor to recommend appropriate Government grants and support for business needs.

Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive, GovTech, said: “COVID-19 has illustrated the importance of digitalisation, and the need to accelerate it within and beyond the public sector. As we take on the new normal of COVID-19, we are re-engineering our back-end digital infrastructure which underpins the delivery of front-end government digital services to citizens, businesses and public officers.”

## **More support for key moments in life**

In April, the Government rolled out a “Covid-19  Guide” on the Moments of Life app. It provides support hotlines for psychological first aid, health information and resources, a directory of online e-commerce services with delivery options, as well as a consolidated directory of government support schemes and grants.

The new feature is part of efforts to serve the needs of citizens during the Covid-19 pandemic, with more features to follow in the coming months.

Later this month, a guide containing useful information about career guidance, job search tips, job opportunities and other available support will be launched in the app to provide more assistance to jobseekers in their career journey.

The Moments of Life app can be downloaded for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/moments-of-life/id1383218758) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.app.mol&hl=en_SG) devices.
