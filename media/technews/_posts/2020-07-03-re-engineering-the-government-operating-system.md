This year, Singapore will be spending an estimated S$3.5 billion on infocomm technology (ICT) projects to accelerate digitalisation and support businesses recovering from the impact of COVID-19. While the ICT procurement and digitalisation roadmap is usually announced at the annual Smart Nation and Digital Government Industry Briefing (IB), this year’s IB is going digital in light of the pandemic.

Since the launch of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative in 2014, the Government has embarked on a journey to re-engineer itself by deepening tech capabilities, modernising digital infrastructure, enhancing service delivery and driving co-creation, in order to deliver a more seamless and pleasant digital service experience for citizens and businesses.

Join us in this session as we discuss how the Government is “upgrading” and “updating” its “Operating System” – the digital interface between users and Government services – to serve citizens and businesses better. 

**This webinar will discuss**
- Singapore’s Smart Nation digitalisation journey and how it has shaped business models in the current climate;  
- Government’s key tech development priorities and challenges;  
- Five broad areas of ICT opportunities in FY 2020; and  
- Role of industry in building a Smart Nation and Digital Government 

**Panellists:

- Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive, GovTech
- Mr Wong Wai Meng, Chairman, SGTech

Moderator: Mr Lau Shih Hor, Honorary Secretary & Chairman, Smart Nation Chapter, SGTech

Missed out on the live webinars and the exciting Question & Answer exchanges between our speakers and the audience? Click on the questions below to see the discussion that went on. 

How can a normal citizen work with GovTech in building more citizen-centric services?

Simon Ang, Assistant Director, Moments of Life, GovTech: There’s a lot of feedback channels available for citizens, we welcome feedback whether good or bad. 

It would be really nice if citizens could provide details about how they’re feeling frustrated about using certain services, or anything that we should be working on. Some of this feedback helps us to be able to follow through and open up more opportunities for discovery and research, and therefore improving the services along the way. 

Just reach out to us and we could be looking at the next generation of products. 


Let’s say a vendor were to collaborate with the government developer portal, how do you guys handle the Intellectual Property (IP) rights for the solutions by our member companies? 

Choong Keng Leong, Director, Managed Hosting Infrastructure, GovTech: The approach for the developer portal is more of a community open-source kind of approach so whatever’s being developed is widely available to anyone, who can contribute to enhance further, to use.

What challenges did the Singapore government face when moving to cloud? Hopefully we can learn from some of these challenges within the Small-Medium Enterprises (SME) community. 

Choong Keng Leong, Director, Managed Hosting Infrastructure, GovTech: First is the readiness or familiarity, or the skillsets of vendors or SMEs with the various Cloud Service Provider (CSP) platforms as well as their cloud competency. There were some challenges getting the right people. The other thing is the familiarity with Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) - how to onboard, get their accounts, there were some challenges around that as well. Lastly, in the first phase it’s mostly lift and shift, we didn’t have the opportunity to modernise these applications to be more microservices, make use of native solutions and so on. So it still goes back to the competency of the vendors and SMEs that we engage in the design or implementation of the system. 


The government has so many sensors (on the ground), are you guys intending to let the industry use that data as well to benefit our own customers and come up with more innovative solutions? 

Chong  Jia Yi, Distinguished Engineer, GovTech: 
Yes we have a Sensors@Gov.sg thing coming along. We have a data link coming live, which allows very fast spatial queries of geospatial data and when it’s mature, we’re planning to roll it out so we can share with the various agencies and also the private sector. 

For example SPOTON, we have a lot of commercial enquiries, so we are making the API framework a lot more mature. We’re hoping that we can perhaps roll it out for different robotics companies, so they can use it in their robotics solutions for very fast, effective temperature scanning. 

If I am a Computer Science undergraduate or graduate, how can I enter the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field? 

Chong  Jia Yi, Distinguished Engineer, GovTech: 
To be honest if you want to talk about AI, we’re really talking about machine learning. And the recent trend is now deep learning. That’s where the hottest field is. So here’s some useful advice for you if you do want to get into the field - one thing I would highly recommend is you have a very strong background in math, especially probability and statistics. You really need that background. You also need a really strong background in algebra. Those would be the two fundamental theoretical backgrounds you need. And then the second part is you really need a strong background in computer science and in particular you should be really strong in algorithms, that’s the sort of thing you really should know.
