TL;DR: In the event of a medical emergency, community first responders can provide crucial assistance to patients and their families before paramedics arrive. TechNews spoke to nursing student Mr Rex Ang Jia Jie to find out how he uses the SCDF’s myResponder app to put his lifesaving skills to good use.

Like a nail to a magnet, Mr Rex Ang Jia Jie rushes to the scene of a medical emergency with his trauma bag each time a siren sounds on his mobile phone. He usually makes it to the patient before an ambulance does, and drawing on his training in first aid and basic cardiac life support, he helps to stabilise the individual and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if necessary.

But Mr Ang isn’t a paramedic with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). In fact, the 20-year-old has not even gone for national service; he is currently pursuing a diploma in nursing at Parkway College of Nursing and Allied Health and will only be enlisted in 2021. In the meantime, he is already saving lives in a personal capacity—as a community first responder (CFR). 

“I’ve always felt a calling to help others, and I thought the best way to contribute was to start getting myself certified in standard first aid, the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) and basic cardiac life support,” said Mr Ang. He bore the cost of training himself, noting that it was “well worth it”—his knowledge and skills have come in handy more than 20 times now since he downloaded the myResponder mobile app on his smartphone in January 2017.

### **Not just lip service**

“Digitalisation is not just about taking a form, converting it into a PDF and putting it online,” Mr Kok cautioned. Instead, it involves re-engineering back-end IT infrastructure so that the form could be made redundant.

Such re-engineering is currently being undertaken by the Singapore government and spearheaded by GovTech, resulting in the [Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS)](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singapore-government-tech-stack/)—a common platform for hosting services, sharing data and building applications. Whereas in the past, government IT architecture comprised monolithic systems with ministry-specific applications, the SGTS has different modules, akin to LEGO bricks, that can be pieced together to give rise to a variety of different digital services.

Importantly, with the SGTS, data can be shared easily between ministries when citizens grant their consent via MyInfo, a repository of government-verified personal information, said Mr Kok. In this way, a re-imagined back-end IT system has drastically reduced the need to fill in forms when transacting online.

### **Ahead in the cloud**

Mr Kok also highlighted that the Singapore government is looking to tap on the commercial cloud to develop digital services. Partnering with leading providers of commercial cloud services will grant organisations access to the latest innovations in the information and communications technology sector.

“We have our Government Data Centre for confidential systems… [but] in our own estimate, more than 70 percent of government IT systems can be hosted on the commercial cloud—with the right classification,” he said, adding that functions classified as ‘restricted’ and below will be offloaded to the cloud.

Furthermore, given the current climate of rampant hacking, Mr Kok urged IT managers to always ask: is your IT architecture designed with security in mind? While commercial cloud providers do have robust cybersecurity measures in place, they should not be taken for granted when developing digital services.

### **Putting people first**

Finally, referencing the [Digital Government Blueprint](https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/?utm_source=top_nav) that was published in June 2018, Mr Kok reiterated the importance of “serving with heart”.

“This is where the primacy of citizens’ needs overwrites the sovereignty of an agency,” he noted. Rather than just develop a policy, then provide specifications for an IT system to translate the policy to operations, GovTech seeks to engage with citizens in the development process, iterating on an outcome based on their requests and feedback.

Citing the Moments of Life (Families) mobile app that was launched last year, Mr Kok explained, “People say they want a dashboard, okay; we put in a dashboard. People say they want to search for healthcare institutions based on whether they qualify for some government scheme, okay; we will continue to enrich [the app].”

“We're still figuring things out, but we're taking a step in the right direction,” Mr Kok concluded.
