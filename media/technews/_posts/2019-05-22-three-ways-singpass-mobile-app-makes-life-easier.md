SingPass Mobile is part of the Singapore Government’s National Digital Identity initiative, which aims to provide more convenience and security for citizens when transacting online. With this app, you no longer need to enter long passwords and carry your token around, What’s more, the app just launched two new features. You now get faster access to your important information and favourite digital services!

### **Forget about long passwords and having “where’s that token?!” moments.**

Built for convenience, the SingPass Mobile app does not even require you to memorise long passwords or key in an SMS one-time password to log in. A six-digit passcode is all that’s needed. 

Biometric authentication options are now also available, whereby you simply have to scan your fingerprint, or hold up your mobile phone for a selfie (facial recognition for selected smartphones), or enter a 6-digit passcode. You can even leave your OneKey token behind when travelling, as all you need is your mobile phone and internet connection to transact online.


### **View your information at a glance**

With the MyInfo Profile feature, you can now view your passport expiry date, CPF contribution history, HDB property details and more, all in one place. 

You no longer need to switch between multiple screens to retrieve your personal information. What a way to save time!

When you select ‘View MyInfo Profile’ in the SingPass Mobile app, you will be prompted to verify your identity using biometric authentication or your six-digit passcode. Thereafter, your profile information will load automatically. The list of information available will increase over time, so keep a lookout for it.


### **Access digital services with a tap**

Even as SingPass Mobile becomes increasingly multifunctional, ease of use remains a top priority. Hence, the SingPass Mobile team has implemented an intuitive navigation system for users in the form of Login Shortcuts.

When you tap on the SingPass Mobile app, you will be shown icons of some frequently used digital services such as those offered by CPF, HDB and NS Portal. Tap on the service you are interested, verify yourself using biometrics or passcode and you will be immediately directed to the relevant services without having to search for them. More shortcuts will be added progressively to make your experience even better.
