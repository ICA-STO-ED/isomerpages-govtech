At the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), developers are far from the typical image of workers hunched over computers, typing lines of code all day.

Instead they do plenty of stand-up and mingling, says software engineer Hoon Ding Yi, whose role is to implement features and solve technical challenges.

“We have cards tagged with the on-going tasks pasted on the walls, and every morning we gather for a team stand-up,” says Ding Yi. During this stand-up session, team members run through their tasks and update their progress with the rest of the team.

They also do “pair programming” – each task is assigned two developers who share ideas and sometimes have “intense” discussions before a single line of code is written”, Ding Yi says.

That written code gets reviewed by the end of the day by team members. This rapid and involved way of working is part of the agile methodology used to develop the Moments of Life (Families) app.
