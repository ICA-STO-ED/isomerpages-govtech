Information and communications technology (ICT) players battered by the Covid-19 crisis will have more opportunities to grow their business in Singapore in the coming months.

To accelerate the country’s digital transformation efforts and help these firms ride through the crisis, the Government will increase the total projected value of its ICT contracts for this financial year, which lasts from April this year to next March, by more than 30 per cent.

This will bring the total value of government ICT contracts for the year to $3.5 billion, a bump up from the previous year’s $2.6 billion.

Eighty per cent of contracts offered will be open to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), said the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) in a press release on Monday.

The agency is spearheading the implementation of the Digital Government Blueprint, a five-year plan outlining how technology will transform the way the Government serves the public.

The ICT projects offered this year will run the gamut across technology domains such as cloud computing, data analytics and communications infrastructure, and will build on the Government’s efforts to co-develop technologies with industry players.

By partnering the industry in these areas, the Government hopes to harness technology to:

●	Provide more citizen- and business-centric digital services;
●	Develop new tech tools in response to Covid-19;
●	Build digital services on cloud systems;
●	Modernise the national ICT infrastructure; and
●	Enhance public service capabilities in data analytics, artificial intelligence and sensors
