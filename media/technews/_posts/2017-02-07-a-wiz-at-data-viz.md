Data, data, everywhere — and too much for us to think.

Or to visualise.

How can data help predict a crime? Or perhaps help you find your dream home?

If you have a fascinating story to tell about data making a difference in your lives, we have a challenge for you.

It’s the National Data Viz Video Challenge, with the theme of “How Open Data makes a difference for you and me”.

It invites you to share in a visually apt way, how open data can help improve daily decision-making, or the quality-of-life for your loved ones.

The competition runs from now until late September 2017.
