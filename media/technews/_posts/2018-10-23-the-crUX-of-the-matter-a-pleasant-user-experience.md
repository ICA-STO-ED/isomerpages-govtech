TL:DR: When it comes to government digital services, a good UX design means less frustration on the part of citizens. At GovTech, a team of UX designers are working behind the scenes to streamline processes and improve touch points between the government and citizens. TechNews spoke to Mr Edison Chee and Mr Philip Man about crafting a good UX.

Have you ever been to a restaurant with fantastic ambience and delicious food, only to lose your appetite because of a rude waiter? A poor user experience (UX) could ruin the good work of every other department in an organisation. Hence, it is important to pay attention to the fine details of the customer journey from the moment of first contact to when they leave satisfied.

UX is equally important in the tech sector, and a government that wants to deliver value to its citizens through digital services cannot afford to ignore it. Mr Edison Chee (Ed) and Mr Philip Man (Phil), UX designers at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), spoke to TechNews about what good UX means to them.

#### **1. What is UX design in the context of government digital services, and why is it important**

**Ed**: Basically, UX stands for user experience, and my job as a UX designer in GovTech is to make sure that citizens’ interactions with government digital services are seamless and pleasant. We do our best to improve the accessibility and usability of apps that we put out there for citizens to use, as well as help make public sector processes easier for citizens to navigate.

**Phil**: In our context, UX is the expression of government policy. Citizens don’t experience a policy paper; what they experience is the implementation of that policy, which could be in the form of a government digital service. At the end of the day, they’ll be asking themselves “Does the service feel good? Was it useful? Was it easy to use?” So good UX design helps make sure that the policy intent is achieved with minimal frustration on the part of citizens.

#### **2. How do you create a good UX?**

**Ed**: We like to start with research. This could be desk research, where we look at trends and data about citizens in a specific context. Sometimes, we visit online forums and see people complaining about a certain process, and that tells us that we need to look into something. Another way is to talk to people and observe their behaviour, engaging them in a very intimate manner to find out as much as we can about how they live their lives and how they interact with the government.

**Phil**: Sometimes, it’s really hard to capture quantitatively in a survey or even through digital means why a person does something the way they do. This is where having an honest face-to-face conversation can reveal many more insights, which we can then act on to improve UX. A large majority of people we speak to say they’re grateful that we took the time to listen to what they had to say. They feel like they are part of a process to improve the UX for others.

**Ed**: Getting the users to test a prototype of an idea is also critical. Sometimes it could be as simple as coming up with an online form, and you want to know whether people know how to read and use the form, whether or not the buttons are visible enough. If people can complete those tasks easily, then you have something successful. I’m never sure that something is going to work until I see it being used.
