The use of mobile apps and social media may be second nature to millennials, but the same can’t always be said for the elderly. Having been brought up in a world where the news was delivered on physical pages and mobile phones were non-existent, some seniors may struggle to keep up with the great advances in the digital realm.

So listen up millennials! As digital natives, you can be tech advocates to the elderly in our midst. For a start, why not share with your grandparents some mobile apps that could help them keep in touch with friends and family, make their lives more convenient and keep them healthy?

This Grandparents’ Day, tell grandpa and grandma about the Moments of Life (Active Ageing) app, the SingPass app and the ActiveSG app. 

### **Cherishing Moments of Life better**

The Moments of Life app, created by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), has recently been modified to meet the needs of citizens above 60 years old. Via the Active Ageing module of the Moments of Life, seniors can browse listings of activities, interest groups or events suitable for them to participate in.

Perhaps grandpa would like to revive his old hobby of Chinese chess? Or maybe grandma wants to have a karaoke session with friends. There’s lots to choose from! Then, if grandpa and grandma want to sit down for some kopi or have a hearty meal after a good mental or physical workout, they can use the app to access certain discounts on food and drinks.

Another important feature of the Moments of Life app is the embedded Merdeka Generation e-card. With this e-card, eligible senior citizens can receive subsidies at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP and dental clinics, as well as discounts at participating merchant outlets. 

### **A first pass at SingPass Mobile**

Whether your grandparents want to check their CPF balances or housing details, they can do so from the convenience of their home using the SingPass Mobile app. If forgetfulness is something that comes with old age, fret not! The SingPass Mobile app does not require users to remember passwords if they choose to use biometric login methods such as fingerprints or facial recognition.

Even better, once logged in, grandpa or grandma will find all their essential information stored under one roof, accessible with just a few taps or swipes. They can even choose to enable notifications for government digital services that they are interested in or frequently use. 

For example, it may be important for seniors to receive regular updates on the amount remaining in their Medisave accounts. The elderly who are thinking of downsizing to a smaller house to extend their retirement funds can also access the Housing Development Board’s services via SingPass Mobile. 

### **3.  Be a good sport and get the ActiveSG app**

Regular exercise is important for everyone but is especially important for the elderly as it helps them to maintain their muscle mass and general health. Should grandpa and grandma feel a bit lethargic and are hesitant to leave the house, perhaps a little incentive for engaging in some fitness activities is in order.

The ActiveSG app will make any millennial go green with envy—from highly-discounted gym membership prices to 1-for-1 ActiveSG Masters Club subscription, seniors will be hard pressed to find a reason not to get out of their seats and onto their feet! Moreover, the ActiveSG app offers an exclusive ‘ActiveSG Merdeka Generation package’ that has an expansive and exciting line-up of activities like Zumba and yoga classes, ready to color up your grandparents’ social lives and keep them in the pink of health.

For those who love sports, don’t say #bojio—the ‘1-for-1 Grandparent and Child ActiveSG Merdeka Generation Programme’ is meant to encourage family bonding, allowing members from different generations to double up on the exercise fun together!

So be sure to install the ActiveSG app on your grandparents’ phones and inform them to sign up to receive S$100 to spend on fitness activities and access to exercise facilities at community centres islandwide (only applicable for first time users of the app)!
