As Singapore restarts its economy, data-driven tech solutions will play a crucial role in helping the nation safely and successfully get back on its feet.

Since the implementation of the circuit breaker measures, Singapore has seen a decline in community COVID-19 cases. As a result, the [Government has recently released a roadmap](https://www.gov.sg/article/ending-circuit-breaker-phased-approach-to-resuming-activities-safely) detailing a three-phase approach to gradually restart the nation’s social and economic activities.

Singapore’s transition into a “Safe Nation”, however, depends upon successfully containing any subsequent waves of COVID-19 in the community. In other words, though the circuit breaker period may be over, it’s no excuse to let our guard down. Practices that support public health such as safe distancing, mask-wearing and even remote work should still be maintained for the time being—and accepted as part and parcel of our new normal.  

Within a short matter of months, developments like TraceTogether and SafeEntry have shown the potential of data-driven technology in helping us adjust to the changes brought about in our daily lives by COVID-19.  To showcase some of these other data-driven solutions, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) invited developers from three different projects onto a webinar on 28 May 2020 to discuss how their solutions address the challenges that could arise as Singapore safely reopens.

### **Staying vigilant*

Such nimble responses to the Covid-19 crisis have underscored the importance of Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, which focuses on harnessing technology to improve lives and livelihoods and stay ahead as a global city.

At a time when lifestyle habits are drastically altered and economic activity disrupted, technology and innovation have been crucial to help citizens and businesses adjust to new norms.

When Madam Crystal Chew, 29, gave birth to her first child in February, she was worried about the amount of paperwork and travelling she would have to do to register her daughter’s birth at the hospital and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority building. 

Her fears were eased when staff at Thomson Medical Centre told her about [Moments of Life](https://www.life.gov.sg/) (MOL), a one-stop mobile platform that provides a suite of government services to support citizens’ needs at various milestones.  

Key features of the mobile application, which was developed for young parents and the elderly include electronic application for birth registration, online access to the child’s immunisation records and access to information on government schemes and benefits. 

Families can also use MOL to register their children in pre-schools in an upcoming pilot trial with NTUC First Campus.

Through the app, Madam Chew was able to register her newborn’s birth from the comfort of her home a few days after being discharged from the hospital. “I liked that I did not have to rush to do the registration during my stay in the hospital.”

She added that the app interface made it easy to use. 

With MOL, the amount of time spent on personal application processes can be whittled down significantly.

At the Committee of Supply (COS) debate this year, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-In-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative, said the app reduces a parent’s waiting time during the birth registration process from an hour to a mere 15 minutes. 

He added that the MOL app, developed by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), will be enhanced later this year to provide more Singaporeans with access to simpler government services. 

According to GovTech, these services will include those related to job hunting, tax management and travel information of Singaporeans living here and abroad.

Since its launch in 2018, the app has been downloaded by more than 150,000 users and used to register six in 10 newborns at both government and private hospitals.

### **Back in business**

Aside from improving the lives of citizens, the Government’s Smart Nation initiative also supports businesses in Singapore.

Last October, the Government launched the [GoBusiness](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences) portal to help business owners with one of the most challenging aspects of starting operations — applying for licences. 

Developed by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office, GovTech and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the portal streamlines regulatory requirements and digitalises transactions between the Government and businesses. It fosters a pro-enterprise environment.

At the COS debate, Dr Balakrishnan cited the “extremely onerous process” that food and beverage (F&B) businesses undergo to apply for the right licences. Such enterprises have as many as 14 different licences to apply for and over 800 form fields to fill out. 

To ease complex application processes, GoBusiness offers a “Guided Journey” feature for F&B businesses that provides a four-step process to help users identify the licences they need and which agency they need to approach to get their business up and running.
 
As of January, over 460 F&B establishments were able to secure their licences quickly and easily through the portal. GovTech added that the portal helps businesses to cut their time spent on licence applications by an average of 10 to 14 days.

To support businesses in Singapore's post-circuit breaker reopening, the Government rolled out an additional platform called [Covid GoBusiness](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/).

The platform provides businesses with useful information such as the list of permitted services allowed to resume operations, applications for exemptions, safe management measures and guidelines, and a list of government support schemes that businesses can apply for during this period. 

Mr Daniel Chan, deputy director of GoBusiness at GovTech, explained that the portal plays a crucial role in guiding companies as they navigate business life amid the Covid-19 situation.

GoBusiness now caters mostly to F&B businesses but will be expanded to include more industry sectors. GovTech will also enhance the platform to provide more assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises, and launch an e-advisor to recommend appropriate Government grants and support for business needs.

## **More support for key moments in life**

In April, the Government rolled out a “Covid-19  Guide” on the Moments of Life app. It provides support hotlines for psychological first aid, health information and resources, a directory of online e-commerce services with delivery options, as well as a consolidated directory of government support schemes and grants.

The new feature is part of efforts to serve the needs of citizens during the Covid-19 pandemic, with more features to follow in the coming months.

The app was recently updated to include a Family Support Calculator for families with children aged six and below to learn more about subsidies, parental leave schemes, benefits and grants that they are eligible for.

Later this month, a guide containing useful information about career guidance, job search tips, job opportunities and other available support will be launched on the app to provide more assistance to jobseekers.

The Moments of Life app can be downloaded for free on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/moments-of-life/id1383218758) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.app.mol&hl=en_SG) devices.
