TL:DR: 20,000 visitors, representing more than 700 cities across 120 countries, attended the Smart City Expo World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, Spain. Singapore received the City Award at the Congress, a recognition of the city-state’s efforts to drive transformation through technology. Minister-in-charge of GovTech Dr Janil Puthucheary highlighted that Singapore’s Smart Nation investments will improve the lives of citizens for generations to come.

Like moths to a flame, people are drawn towards cities for the resources and opportunities offered by these urban centres. Yet, just as the insect eventually finds the heat of the flame unbearable, people may come to realise that city life is less ideal than what they had envisioned. Issues like housing and healthcare costs, traffic congestion and pollution can make a city intolerable for its inhabitants if not managed properly.

Acknowledging these problems, governments around the world are taking steps to make cities more liveable. Using technology, they are developing systems of monitoring and feedback to leverage data and optimise everything from energy use to urban planning. It was thus apt that Barcelona—known as one of the smartest cities in the world for its pervasive digital connectivity and clever use of the Internet of Things (IoT)—played host to the Smart City Expo World Congress (SCEWC) 2018.

“We are here in Barcelona to learn how we can do more [with smart cities], to take back the best possible lessons for our people,” said Singapore’s Minister-in-charge of GovTech and Senior Minister of State for Transport, Communications and Information Dr Janil Puthucheary in his speech at the conference.
