"The GovTech@MOE team challenged ourselves to not be satisfied with the status quo and to re-think and architect the next phase of the Schools Standard ICT Operating Environment (SSOE). In doing so and through the innovative use of technologies, we hope to bring schools' ICT infrastructure capabilities to the next level to better support current needs, and also enable future Teaching and Learning needs of our Teachers and Students." 

**Mr Tan Bee Teck, Chief Information Officer, Ministry of Education**
