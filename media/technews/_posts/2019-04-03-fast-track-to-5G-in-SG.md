Wireless connectivity through the times has changed the way we work, communicate and develop products. It has enabled analogue voice tranmission to digital pictures and texting, and to recently and crucially, mobile data. The upcoming 5G, will provide  an incredible amount of bandwith, which means data transfer will be dramatically faster and latency will be reduced.

The Smart Nation ambition will greatly benefit from this emerging technology in various domains from transportation to medical and even public safety.
