Mr Kok Ping Soon, Deputy Secretary (Development) in the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), will be appointed as Chief Executive (CE) of the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) with effect from 1 May 2018. He succeeds Ms Jacqueline Poh. Ms Poh’s next appointment will be announced in due course.

As Deputy Secretary (Development), MOM, Mr Kok oversees national policies and programmes related to Workplace Safety and Health, Human Capital Development, and SGSecure for Workplaces, as well as initiatives on service excellence, digitalisation, people engagement and future-ready capability building.

Prior to his appointment at MOM, Mr Kok was Senior Director, National Security Co-ordination Centre within the National Security Co-ordination Secretariat in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). Mr Kok has also held various positions in Ministry of Trade & Industry, Ministry of Manpower, Singapore Tourism Board and Economic Development Board.  

Ms Poh was Managing Director (MD) of the Info-communications Development Authority (IDA) from 2013 to 2016 before IDA was restructured. As CE of GovTech since 2016, she set the strategic direction for GovTech as the implementing agency of the Smart Nation Strategic National Projects (SNPs). She was also instrumental in rebuilding the Government’s capabilities in ICT and smart systems, data science and artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, application design and development, and Internet of Things. 

Under her stewardship, GovTech set up the Government Digital Services at Hive to develop citizen-centric digital products such as the OneService app, Parking.sg and the National Trade Platform. Ms Poh also led GovTech to further strengthen the Singapore Government’s cybersecurity posture and resiliency of key government ICT systems and infrastructure.

 “The Board of GovTech would like to thank Jacqueline for transforming GovTech into an organisation that is bold and prepared to take risks in getting things done. Under Jacqueline’s leadership, GovTech has been able to deliver innovative and imaginative solutions that have taken Singapore forward in its journey to becoming a technology-enabled society. Her leadership in moulding this culture will be a lasting legacy,” said Mr Ng Chee Khern, Permanent-Secretary (Smart Nation and Digital Government) and Chairman of GovTech.

“GovTech welcomes Ping Soon, who will build on the strong foundation laid by Jacqueline. Ping Soon is a person who cares for people, and I expect he will continue to develop the most important capability in GovTech - the people and its culture - further strengthening and embedding the changes that Jacqueline initiated,” added Mr Ng.
