**MyInfo Profile as a step towards an enhanced National Digital Identity**

By December 2017, all registered SingPass users can benefit from the MyInfo Profile which is designed to reduce the hassle of filling up online forms for government digital services.

This Profile will be automatically available to all government agencies, ensuring a seamless and convenient experience for users. Users can also authorise certain private sector entities to use their MyInfo Profile to pre-fill forms.  An extra layer of consent will be required to release financial information, such as CPF or income tax statements. 

The MyInfo Profile takes on a “Tell Us Once” approach so that users are not required to repeatedly provide and verify the same personal information to government agencies when transacting online. After the user has successfully authenticated his identity via SingPass, his basic personal details will be used to fill up online forms from participating agencies, each time he performs a transaction.

**In line with Smart Nation Drive**

This is a step towards an enhanced National Digital Identity (NDI), a Strategic National Project in the Smart Nation drive. SingPass acts as an authentication gateway, while the MyInfo service provides the user’s basic personal data to form the digital user profile, to make transactions easier and more secure. The NDI will provide users with a single digital identity to transact with both the Government and private sectors.

Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State (Communications and Information, Education), and Minister-in-Charge of the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), announced this development today at an innovation event, and highlighted the Government’s continued commitment to make government digital services more secure, user-friendly and intuitive for citizens, as part of the commitment towards a Smart Nation that offers benefits and opportunities for all.

Since launching in early 2016, MyInfo has received encouraging response with close to 200,000 sign ups. Currently, MyInfo is available on 24 digital services, such as applications for new flats and the Baby Bonus scheme. The MyInfo profile will be further rolled out for 140 government digital services such as applying for ActiveSG and SkillsFuture Credits by 2018. 

MyInfo to be extended to more private sector services

In May 2017, MyInfo was extended to the banking sector with four participating banks. When transacting, consent is sought before personal details of bank customers are retrieved from MyInfo. To date, 19 digital services have successfully been onboarded, including applications for credit cards and the opening of new bank accounts.  

The Government will be extending MyInfo to more locally-registered businesses to continue to improve digital user experiences.

**About MyInfo**

Designed to make applications for government digital services more automatic, users of MyInfo need only provide their personal details once to the Government for government transactions to be hassle-free. Once users’ details have been captured by the relevant participating agencies, MyInfo will automatically fill out government online forms with the users’ consent.
