**GovTech and CSA partner cybersecurity community on Government Bug Bounty Programme** 

The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and Cyber Security Agency (CSA) of Singapore will partner local and overseas hackers on a Government Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP) from December 2018 to January 2019. 

Under the GBBP, ‘white hat’ hackers – or ethical hackers – will be invited to search for and uncover vulnerabilities in ICT systems, where they will receive monetary rewards in return. Rewards can range from US$250 to US$10,000 depending on the severity of the ‘bug’ discovered by registered/authorised hackers. Discovered ‘bugs’ will be reported to the organisation for remediation. 

The GBBP will run over a period of three weeks, and involves five selected internet-facing government systems and websites with high user touchpoints: gov.sg website; REACH website; Ministry of Communications & Information’s Press Accreditation Card (PAC) Online; Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) website; and MFA eRegister. 

GovTech and CSA will be partnering HackerOne – the world’s largest community of cybersecurity researchers and white hat hackers - for the GBBP. HackerOne successfully organised the Ministry of Defence’s first BBP earlier this year.

The GBBP is part of the Singapore Government’s ongoing efforts to build a secure and resilient Smart Nation. With cyber attacks growing in scale and complexity, the GBBP will help to build an innovative cyber ecosystem, draw in a wide range of expertise to help identify the Government’s cyber blind spots, and benchmark its defences against skilled global hackers.

By bringing together a community of cyber defenders who share the common goal of developing a safe and resilient cyberspace, the GBBP aims to build a shared sense of collective ownership over the cybersecurity of Government systems and websites, which is vital to achieve Singapore’s Smart Nation goals.

Key findings from the GBBP will be shared in March 2019. The GBBP will be expanded to include more Government ICT systems/websites in future.
