**NParks and SNDGG trial SPOT robot for safe distancing operations at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park**<br>

The National Parks Board (NParks) and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (comprising Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and Government Technology Agency) are conducting a pilot trial of a four-legged robot called SPOT to assist safe distancing efforts at parks, gardens and nature reserves managed by NParks, including Park Connectors, Pulau Ubin, as well as parks managed by town councils. 

**Trial in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park**

From today (8 May), NParks and SNDGG will be deploying SPOT over a 3-km stretch in the River Plains section of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park for two weeks during off-peak hours. A recorded message will be broadcast from SPOT to remind park visitors to observe safe distancing measures. SPOT will also be fitted with cameras – enabled with GovTech-developed video analytics – to estimate the number of visitors in parks. These cameras will not be able to track and/or recognise specific individuals, and no personal data will be collected.

SPOT will be controlled remotely, reducing the manpower required for park patrols and minimising physical contact among staff, volunteer safe distancing ambassadors and park visitors. This lowers the risk of exposure to the virus. Unlike wheeled robots, SPOT works well across different terrains and can navigate obstacles effectively, making it ideal for operation in public parks and gardens.

SPOT is fitted with safety sensors to detect objects and people in its path. It has in-built algorithms to detect an object or person within 1 metre of its proximity to avoid collision. SPOT will be accompanied by at least one NParks officer during the trial period. 

Should the trial prove successful, NParks will consider deploying SPOT at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park during the morning and evening peak hours. NParks will also study plans to deploy SPOT to other parks such as the Jurong Lake Gardens.

SPOT is also currently being trialled at the Changi Exhibition Centre community isolation facility to deliver essential items such as medicine to patients. SNDGG will also explore the use of SPOT to support other COVID-19 related operations across agencies.

Technology has been used to help NParks in safe distancing work. The Safe Distance @ Parks portal [safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg](https://safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg), for instance, was developed by NParks to allow the public to look for a park near them and check visitorship levels before leaving their house. A total of 30 drones are also being deployed in selected parks and nature areas to provide officers with a high vantage point to obtain visitorship updates quickly, complementing ground observations, as well as give them a better sense of the density of visitors in a specific area. 

8	NParks and MOH reiterate the advice for the public to stay home to minimise the risk of COVID-19 spread. If they wish to exercise (walk, jog and cycle), they should go to a park or park connector that is in their neighbourhood alone, and return to their home thereafter. They are required to wear masks when outside their homes except when doing strenuous exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling or walking in hilly terrain, for example in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Nature Park.
