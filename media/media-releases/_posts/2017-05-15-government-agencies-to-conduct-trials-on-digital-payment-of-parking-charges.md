In line with our vision to become a Smart Nation, the Government is developing a digital parking mobile application to allow motorists to pay parking charges through their mobile devices.

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Housing & Development Board (HDB), in partnership with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), are developing a mobile application for motorists to use at public car parks that currently use paper coupons.

The mobile app will provide more convenience for motorists as they need not return to their vehicles to add more coupons to extend their parking session. The benefits of the app include:

* **Paying for parking digitally:** Motorists can use the app to key in their vehicle number, select the car park, indicate their parking duration and start parking.
* **Calculating parking charges automatically:** The app automatically calculates the charges that motorists have to pay based on their parking duration on a per minute basis. A refund will be given if motorists choose to end their parking session earlier.
* **Extending parking session remotely:** The app allows motorists to track the validity of their parking session. They can extend the duration of their parking session at their own time and convenience.
A trial will be conducted among public sector officers from May to June 2017 to test the functionalities of the app at selected public car parks in the city area. During this period, we will test the app, especially the payment module, to be confident of its robustness before we extend the trial to the general public. With the feedback gathered from the trial, the agencies will improve the app for better user experience. Please refer to Annex A for the list of participating public car parks.

The plan is to extend the trial to members of the public later this year. More details of the public trial will be announced later.

As part of our Smart Nation and Digital Government efforts, the Government will continually experiment with new ways of using technology to improve the quality of lives of citizens. This will involve taking in user feedback early in the product development cycle through various trials and enhancing the product with new features along the way. This agile and iterative way of developing government digital products will enable the Government to push out innovations to benefit citizens quicker.
