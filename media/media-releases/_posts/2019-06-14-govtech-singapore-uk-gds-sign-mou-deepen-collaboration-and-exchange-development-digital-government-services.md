**GovTech Singapore and the UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS) sign MoU to deepen collaboration and exchange in the development of Digital Government Services**

Singapore’s Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) yesterday (Jun 13) to strengthen collaboration in the design and delivery of digital government public services.

Under the MoU, GovTech and GDS will mutually share knowledge and best practices in improving the delivery of digital public services, building digital skills and capabilities of Government officials, and adopting open standards for government information, data and software.

The MoU signing took place at No. 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer. Representing the agencies to sign the MoU were Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive of GovTech Singapore and Mr Kevin Cunnington, Director General of GDS U.K. 

Chief Executive of GovTech Singapore, Kok Ping Soon, said: “GovTech is delighted to sign our first MoU with GDS U.K., a leader in the use of digital, technology and data to transform government. The MoU will facilitate greater sharing of experiences and expertise in the development of digital platforms and services to better serve our citizens and businesses. It will also allow mutual exchange of officers to build capabilities and explore opportunities for collaboration to strengthen the digital partnership between the two organisations.”

Head of the UK Government Digital Service, Kevin Cunnington, said: “GDS is delighted to have signed this MoU with our colleagues in Singapore. By sharing knowledge and working together, we can ensure that Government works better for everyone by leading the digital transformation of public services both here in the UK and in Singapore.”

The MoU comes at a time when the two countries are actively engaged in the SG-UK Partnership for the Future. Launched in January 2019 by the UK’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the campaign expands and solidifies existing links while creating new opportunities for collaboration that secure the future bilateral partnership between the two nations.
