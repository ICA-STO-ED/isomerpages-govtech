The myResponder app taps on the active community to respond as quickly as possible to improve the chances of survival. In other words, an app to crowdsource for lifesavers. 

It notifies registered Community First Responders, who are trained in life-saving skills, of medical emergencies and fire cases happening within a 400m radius, building a community of good Samaritans. 

To date, close to 30,000 cases have been responded to through the myResponder app.
