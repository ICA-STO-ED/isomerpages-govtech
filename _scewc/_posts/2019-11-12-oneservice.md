The OneService App is a convenient way for members of the public to provide feedback on municipal issues without the hassle of knowing which relevant Government agency to approach. 

Adopting an issue-based approach, reported cases will be routed to relevant agencies in a seamless and coordinated manner. This improved interaction between the public and Government agencies has resulted in more than 190,000 downloads of the app since 2015. This avenue for feedback on issues relating to the userâ€™s neighbourhood helps to improve living conditions for Singaporeans.

An additional feature of the app includes an option to activate an alert which will be sent to users when they are close to dengue clusters. It includes information such as the number of dengue cases in the neighbourhood and the block of flats where the cases are located.
