The sense-making in estate management concept will focus on providing intelligence to Government agencies, industries and citizens, informing decisions and improving the quality of life in an estate.

Comprising an integrated 3D platform that converts sensor data, and information such as geospatial and building data into 3D models, test conditions of current or new products and services can also be simulated to aid in decision-making for real-world implementations.

The concept extends the capabilities of the existing Smart Nation Sensor Platform, by enabling agencies to sense-make, contextualise and act on insights from the sensor data. Features such as augmented and virtual-reality capabilities will also transform the way Government agencies conduct their operations.

Some uses of the concept include power consumption projection to enable Government agencies to set targets for consumption reduction; monitoring of human traffic conditions in public spaces to measure the potential impact of large crowds at a specific location and enabling emergency first responders to identify the entry and exit points of places. It can also determine cooling and lighting requirements as well as the structural integrity of a building.
