The GoBusiness Licensing Portal, a pro-enterprise digitalisation effort to enable a simpler, faster and better process for businesses to apply for licenses, permits and certificates from the government. This helps business owners save time and reduce compliance cost so that they can focus on their core business. 

The portal features a Guided Journey, which is a step-by-step guide that help businesses navigate the licensing landscape to determine the licenses required, and the order to apply for them. 

The GoBusiness Licensing portal was officially launched on 31 Oct 2019. It is the result of a deep dive into the regulatory requirements for the food services sector, which reviewed how to streamline regulations, and simplify and automate processes from the businessesâ€™ perspective. 

The retail sector has been identified as the next sector to be covered by the GoBusiness Portal. There are also plans to streamline other types of transactions between businesses and the government, such as grant applications, so that businesses can experience seamless and convenient service from the government throughout the business life cycle.
