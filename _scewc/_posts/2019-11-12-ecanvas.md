The eCanvas, a neural-networked voice command system, provides greater independence for persons with disabilities to pursue their artistic endeavours.
 
It features a motorised aluminium frame that clamps onto a drawing canvas and brings the canvas within reach of the painter. The connected microphone receives voice commands from the painter and activates the system to move to dispense paint on a palette. Instead of being just a generic system, the voice command system can be customised to suit the needs of the person with disabilities.
 
The eCanvas project demonstrates how technology is used to improve lives and promote digital inclusivity. This technology can be adapted to serve all segments of society such as the elderly, which will comprise 25% of Singaporeâ€™s population by the year 2030.
