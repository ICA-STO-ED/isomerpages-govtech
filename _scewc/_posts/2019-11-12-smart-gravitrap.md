The Smart Gravitrap enhances mosquito surveillance efforts in the fight against dengue, which is endemic in Singapore. The prototype attracts and traps dengue-spreading female Aedes mosquitoes looking for sites to lay their eggs in.

The sensors in the device also capture mosquito flight signatures and identifies species and gender, for remote data collection and analysis to reduce the reliance on manpower. It can, in future, be integrated into the existing Gravitrap network, to form an islandwide intelligent mosquito surveillance system and reduce the risk of dengue.
