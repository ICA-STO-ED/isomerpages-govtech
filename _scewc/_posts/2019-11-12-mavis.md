Tapping on assistive technologies, the Mobility Assistance for the Visually Impaired and Special Users (MAVIS) mobile app, provides a customised journey guidance for commuters with special needs. As part of its feature, it sends smartphone alerts which includes the estimated time of arrival and notifications for when to board and alight the bus.

An audio announcement feature can also be switched on to alert visually impaired passengers via a special type of hearing aid of the service number of the bus and the last destination when they are at the boarding bus stop. Once they are on board the bus, it will send alerts to notify them of the upcoming bus stop.

This trial supports one of the themes of the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 which focuses on making the Singaporeâ€™s transport system more inclusive and creating a better commuting journey for all members of society including persons with special needs.
