### **Overview**

Thank you for visiting the Singapore Pavilion. 
 
Singapore was named Smart City of the Year at the Smart City Expo World Congress in November 2018 for our Smart Nation initiative which promotes digital technology and innovation to boost liveability and sustainability. 
 
The Singapore Smart Nation initiative revolves around three core pillars - creating a Digital Government that allows its officers to be digitally-enabled to serve; empowering the lives of our citizens and ensuring that all have equal opportunities in a Digital Society; and creating a Digital Economy to ensure that Singapore stays viable in attracting businesses and talents. 
 
For Singapore to realise our Smart Nation vision, our people, businesses and public agencies will each have their key roles to play. This collaboration between the people, private and public sectors ensures that we are able to deliver citizen- and business- centric digital solutions and build stronger communities across boundaries. 
 
The Singapore Pavilion features over 35 tech initiatives from the private and public sectors that span domains like infrastructure, community, transport, inclusivity, education, finance, environment, citizen and business innovation. Initiatives such as the Singapore Government Tech Stack and National Digital Identity deliver seamless and secure digital Government services; the Moments of Life and eCanvas help to empower the lives of citizens from various segments in society; and the IPOS GO and GoBusiness Licensing Portal help improve efficiency, enabling more opportunities for enterprises.
