The Government has progressively built up the digital infrastructure and engineering capabilities as the foundation of our Smart Nation. These enable us to respond decisively and swiftly to the COVID-19 outbreak with a suite of digital tools to help disseminate timely and accurate information to Singaporeans, and to enable our fellow agencies to better manage the crisis.

### **Ask Jamie chatbot**

Ask Jamie is a virtual assistant designed to answer queries within specific domains on Government agency websites. Launched in 2014, Ask Jamie has been implemented across 70 Government agency websites.

Amid the Covid-19 situation, Ask Jamie has been enhanced to address queries related to the virus, which helped to reduce overall call centre volumes. The chatbot uses machine learning to improve accuracy of the replies, and data analytics to detect trending topics.

In addition to the Gov.sg and Ministry of Health websites, citizens are also able to access the chatbot via Facebook Messenger and Telegram:

 - [Gov.sg](www.gov.sg)
 - [Moh.gov.sg](www.moh.gov.sg)
 - [go.gov.sg/askjamiebotfbm](www.go.gov.sg/askjamiebotfbm)
 - [go.gov.sg/askjamiebottg](www.go.gov.sg/askjamiebottg)
 
The chatbot is developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech).

The thermometer is retrofitted with a motion-sensing camera and a power source to enable it to do a temperature scan without human intervention.
