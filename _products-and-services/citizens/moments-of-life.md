The Moments of Life app is a Smart Nation initiative that places citizens at the heart of government digital services. It currently supports families with children aged 6 below and seniors aged 60 above by bundling useful services and information on a single digital platform.

A COVID-19 Curated Guide was launched in April 2020 to provide the public with easy access to important COVID-19 information. The in-app guide offers useful resources such as information on the various COVID-19 assistance schemes announced by the government recently, health information, various government tools such as finding a PHPC doctor, community initiatives. There is also a page to apply for government support and grants, where users can find the most relevant grants to apply for.

The app is the first step towards delivering integrated services and information that citizens need, when they need it, through a single platform. It was developed based on insights gathered through citizen engagement sessions to identify and better understand usersâ€™ challenges and needs. More features will be rolled out on the app progressively.
