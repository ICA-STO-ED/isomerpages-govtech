The Moments of Life app is a Smart Nation initiative that supports families with children aged 6 and below by bundling useful services and information on a single digital platform. It is a one-stop, convenient option to access relevant services and information, including:

![Moments of Life Product Features](/images/programmes/products-and-services/MOL-Landing-Page_1.png)

* Registering a child’s birth and applying for Baby Bonus online in a single form;

* Searching for and indicating interest for suitable preschool facilities through the use of geolocation technology, with accompanying information on school fees and vacancies;

* Accessing a child’s upcoming medical appointments and immunisation records.

The MOL app also provides parents-to-be and caregivers with up-to-date Government content on applicable schemes and benefits, parenting information and event listings based on their topics of interest.

The app is the first step towards delivering integrated services and information that citizens need, when they need it, through a single platform, and was developed based on insights gathered through citizen engagement sessions to identify and better understand parents’ challenges and needs.
