Moments of Life is a Smart Nation initiative that places citizens at the centre of developing digital Government services. It is a mobile app containing a suite of services which supports citizens’ needs at key junctures, by integrating and bundling services across Government agencies. 

Key features of the app are developed for families with children aged 6 below and seniors aged 60 above by bundling useful services and information on a single digital platform.

A COVID-19 Curated Guide was launched in April 2020 to provide users with easy access to important COVID-19 information. The in-app guide offers useful resources such as information on the various COVID-19 assistance schemes announced by the government, health information, various government tools such as finding a PHPC doctor, community initiatives. 

The app is the first step towards delivering integrated services and information that citizens need, when they need it, through a single platform. It was developed based on insights gathered through citizen engagement sessions to identify and better understand users’ challenges and needs.
