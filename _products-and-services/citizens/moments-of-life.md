![Moments of Life is now LifeSG](/images/technews/lifesg-banner.png)

The LifeSG app is a Smart Nation initiative that helps citizens access government services and information in one convenient place. We make government services more easy-to-use by personalising experiences, anticipating citizens’ needs and providing meaningful solutions on a single platform. With a simplified experience, citizens can save time and focus on the things that matter. 

### **Is the LifeSG app new?**

Formerly known as Moments of Life, the app was launched in June 2018 to support families with young children and seniors. Currently, 7 in 10 Singaporean births have been registered with the app. 
 
With the rebranding to LifeSG, we plan to expand and serve citizens beyond key moments in their lives. Users will see new interface with improved navigation, topical guides and the following features:
 
 - Explore Services - a feature for citizens to access more than 40 government services and information easily. These services are grouped into simple and clear topics, such as family and parenting, work and employment, healthcare, and more. 

 - Personal Dashboard – a dashboard with recommended content, notifications and action items for users to manage their applications and deadlines. 

Over time, we hope to include more features and relevant digital services for citizens.Visit www.life.gov.sg for more information.
