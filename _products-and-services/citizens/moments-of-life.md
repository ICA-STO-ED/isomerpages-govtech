The Moments of Life app is a Smart Nation initiative that places citizens at the heart of government digital services. It currently supports families with children aged 6 below and seniors aged 60 above by bundling useful services and information on a single digital platform.

The app is the first step towards delivering integrated services and information that citizens need, when they need it, through a single platform. It was developed based on insights gathered through citizen engagement sessions to identify and better understand usersâ€™ challenges and needs. More features will be rolled out on the app progressively.
