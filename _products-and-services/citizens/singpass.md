[SingPass](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/spauth/login/loginpage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login){:target="_blank"}, which stands for Singapore Personal Access, is an authentication system for citizens to transact online with the Government. 

With a SingPass account, users can access hundreds of government digital services easily and securely. Managed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), users will need to enter their SingPass ID and password, followed by a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via SMS, or generated through a OneKey token. Alternatively, they can use the SingPass Mobile app to log in using their fingerprint, facial recognition (for selected smartphones) or a 6-digit passcode. This provides an additional layer of security via 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) to better protect users' personal data.


### **Ever-improving Security Measures**

Along with 2FA, users should also play their part to protect their account and personal information. Here are some tips:

* Do not share login information: Keep your SingPass ID, password and 2FA details confidential.
* Do not re-use passwords: Certain websites that you access may not be secure. Log-in information may be stolen from these sites and used to hack your SingPass account.
* Be aware of phishing sites: Some sites may look like government websites to trick you Always check that the URL is correct (www.singpass.gov.sg) with a ‘lock’ icon in the address bar.


### **More seamless logins using SingPass Mobile**

In October 2018, we launched the SingPass Mobile app as an alternative mode of 2FA to provide citizens with more choices and easier access to government digital services – including biometrics for easy authentication.
 
With SingPass Mobile, users can now log in to digital services within seconds using just their fingerprint, facial recognition (for selected smartphones) or a 6-digit passcode. More features will be added to the SingPass Mobile app progressively, such as one-tap access to popular government digital services and a dashboard to view the user's personal information at a glance within the app.
