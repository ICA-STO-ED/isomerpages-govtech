When planning out digital government services, our GovTech teams go beyond the usual product brief with the idea of “Designing for the 100%” to consider accessibility use cases for digital inclusion. As more services become digital, by ensuring accessibility wider than the majority, we will be able to provide better user experiences for everyone.

### **Isomer**

Isomer is a static website builder for public officers to easily launch informational sites.

**Isomer's Target Audience:**

Isomer’s audience include (a) content creators (public officers in comms and marketing, policy officers and IT department) as well as software vendors who partner government agencies (b) content consumers  (Singaporean citizens from all walks of life who visit Isomer-built websites)

**What has the team done to make Isomer more inclusive?** 

 - Standard template for users to launch their websites in an easy and fast manner
 - The team baked in as many accessibility features into Isomer as possible by default.
For example, the Isomer template provides a selection of predefined font sizes and weights that cater to persons with low vision. Content editors can focus on content, knowing the font size issue is well addressed.
 - While the team was not able to set the use of alternate text for images or a minimum color contrast ratio, they overcame these challenges by creating documentation guides for easy referencing of accessibility guidelines.
