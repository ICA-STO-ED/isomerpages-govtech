The InnoLeap programme by GovTech offers both online and offline collaboration platforms to serve as a catalyst for transforming problem statements into innovative solutions in a digital ecosystem. Online engagement takes place on the Ideas! [Ideas!](https://ideas.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} portal, the government’s crowdsourcing portal. Offline platforms serve to raise awareness of current and upcoming technologies, seed potential use cases, facilitate robust exchange of business needs and technology ideas between public sector agencies and solution providers in the form of technology companies, Research Institutes (RIs) and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). Challenges and problem statements are identified for innovative problem solving and implementation through these platforms, which include:

### **Online Collaboration Platform** 

**InnoLeap on Ideas! Portal [(ideas.gov.sg)](https://ideas.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}**
GovTech conducts market scans, crowdsourcing and innovation-related activities through the Ideas! crowdsourcing portal, which include Calls for Ideas, Calls for Solutions and Calls for Co-Innovation partners. This digital platform provides end-to-end collaboration opportunities for the community and industry to co-create and co-develop to solve agencies’ challenges.

### **Offline Collaboration Platforms** 

**Sharing Days**
These are organised to raise the level of awareness of emerging technologies among officers in government agencies. Technology partners, i.e. companies, RIs and IHLs, are invited to present and give demonstrations for their technologies related to a specific theme. At the end of the session, time is allocated for consultation with the technology partners. Sharing Days can be organised for a single agency or a group of agencies from a specific domain.

**Thematic Workshops**
These are conducted based on themes and common needs identified from agencies' demand. In these workshops, participants from the agencies are exposed to a network of technology companies with innovative products or solutions. Each participant should bring along problem statements relating to their area of work (to address immediate operational or longer term issues) for in-depth discussion with the technology companies and to explore potential collaborations and pilots.

**Clinics**
Deep dive clinics are conducted with agencies to understand their problem statements before facilitating the link-up with suitable technology partners to explore potential collaborations and pilots.
Hackathons – These are organised with partners to develop interesting ideas and solutions to solve agencies’ challenges, by tapping on the expertise from the community and industry.
