As part of the Government Technology Agency’s (GovTech) ongoing efforts to ensure the cyber-security of public sector IT systems and services (collectively “PS Services”), GovTech has established this suspected **vulnerability disclosure programme** (“VDP”) to encourage the responsible reporting of suspected vulnerabilities or weaknesses in IT services, systems, resources and/or processes which may potentially affect PS Services. We look forward to working with the cyber-security research community and members of the public to keep PS Services safe for all users.  

For clarity, the VDP does not authorise or permit the taking of any action which may contravene applicable laws and regulations (e.g. Computer Misuse Act). For the avoidance of doubt, attempts to exploit or test suspected vulnerabilities (e.g. gaining unauthorised access to any computer program or data) are prohibited.

You are expected to conduct yourself responsibly at all times and if you are in any doubt about any proposed course of conduct, please contact us immediately at <cybersecurity@tech.gov.sg>.

### **What you can do to help**

a.  Upon detection of a suspected vulnerability, notify us immediately or as soon as practicable by submitting a report through our disclosure partner at: [https://hackerone.com/sg-vdp](https://hackerone.com/sg-vdp){:target="_blank"}, or contact us directly via email at <cybersecurity@tech.gov.sg>.

b.	Provide your name, email and mobile number in the suspected vulnerability report so that we may contact you for clarifications, and where applicable, include the name(s) and email(s) of other person(s) to whom you may have disclosed the suspected vulnerability.

c.	Provide adequate information in the suspected vulnerability report so that we may work with you on validating the suspected vulnerability, including these details (where available):<br>
<br>
<ol type="i">
<li>Description of the suspected vulnerability.</li><br>
 <ol type="ii">
<li>IP address and/or URL of the subject PS Service.</li><br>
<ol type="iii">
<li>Configuration and version of the subject software.</li><br>
<ol type="iv">
<li>Description of the circumstances, including date(s) and time(s), leading to your reporting of the suspected vulnerability.</li><br>
<ol type="v">
<li>Description of the reason(s) why you believe the suspected vulnerability may impact the subject PS Service and the extent of such suspected potential impact (e.g. describe how you believe the suspected vulnerability might potentially operate).<br></li>

### **What NOT to do**

a.	Act in any way which may contravene applicable laws and regulations (e.g. the Computer Misuse Act).<br>
<br>
b.	Publish or publicly disclose any suspected vulnerability to any third party save for us and our disclosure partner before it is resolved as malicious actors may exploit the suspected vulnerability to cause damage, harm or loss to individuals and organisations.<br>
<br>
c.	Deploy destructive, disruptive or other unlawful means to detect vulnerabilities (e.g. attacks on physical security, social engineering, denial of service, brute force attacks).<br>
<br>
d.	Exploit, test or otherwise use any suspected vulnerability (e.g. taking any step(s) to access, copy, create, delete, modify, manipulate or download any data or programme, build system backdoor(s), modify system configuration(s), facilitate or share system access).<br>

If you are in any doubt about any proposed course of conduct, please contact us immediately at <cybersecurity@tech.gov.sg>.

### **As part of the VDP, GovTech will:**

a.	Act as coordinator between you and the relevant public sector agency or agencies (“Stakeholders”) which may possibly be affected by the suspected vulnerability.<br>
<br>
b.	Acknowledge receipt of your suspected vulnerability report and notify the Stakeholders of the suspected vulnerability within generally 3 business days from our receipt of your report.<br>
<br>
c.	Work with you and the Stakeholders to resolve any validated vulnerability within generally 90 business days from our receipt of your report.<br>
<br>
d.	Upon the validation of your suspected vulnerability report and at our sole discretion, accord appropriate recognition to you for your contribution(s) in reporting and/or resolving the validated vulnerability.<br>

### **Please note that GovTech does not and will not in any way:**

a.	Accord or provide you with any kind of exemption, immunity, indemnity or shield from civil or criminal liability (if any) under applicable laws and regulations.<br>
<br>
b.	Be liable for any expense, damage or loss of any kind which you may incur due to any action taken or not taken by us in relation to any suspected vulnerability you may report.<br>
<br>
c.	Accept or assume any responsibility for the contents of any suspected vulnerability report submitted by you, nor shall our acknowledgment or processing of such report constitute any kind of acceptance or endorsement of the contents therein.<br>
<br>
d.	Be obliged to consult you for any media or public statement that we and/or any Stakeholders may decide to publish or release in relation to the suspected or validated vulnerability.<br>
<br>
e.	Provide you with any cash reward or financial incentive of any kind for the detection and/or resolution of the validated vulnerability.
