### **Background / Objectives**

The Digital Government Customer Perception Survey (Citizens) is conducted annually by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to assess citizen’s satisfaction of key digital government services; and to identify areas for further improvement.
The survey was conducted from October to November 2017 for the reporting period of FY2016 (i.e. 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017).
 
### **Research Methodology**
1,500 respondents, comprising representatives of the total demographic population above the age of 19, were surveyed. Data collection was done via face-to-face interviews.

### **Survey Results**

8.4 out of 10 (84.0%) respondents used Government digital services for personal matters in the past 12 months of the financial year. Around 9 out of 10 (93.0%) respondents, who have used digital government services, would provide positive feedback on digital government services if asked. For the 16% that have not used digital government services, the majority have other family members that are transacting with the Government on their behalf, or indicated that they have no need to transact with the Government. 

More than 92.0% of the respondents expressed satisfaction with the overall quality of digital government services (rating of 4 and above – out of a scale of 6).  72.5% of the respondents expressed that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the services (rating of 5 and above – out of a scale of 6).  The results were comparable to previous years.

6.5 out of 10 respondents (65.0%) made payments to the Government in the past 12 months, with the most common payment mode was online via bank transfer or GIRO facilities. Among those who made payments to the Government 97.0% expressed satisfaction with the e-payment services provided by the Government (rating of 4 and above – out of a scale of 6), while almost 77% (76.3%) were satisfied or very satisfied (rating of 5 and above – out of a scale of 6).
