The Parking.sg mobile application provides users with an alternative mode of payment to paper parking coupons. In just three simple steps - key in the vehicle number, select the carpark code then select the intended parking duration and one can be off, on the way for the next appointment! The app calculates charges based on a per-minute basis and a refund on the remaining amount will be given should the user choose to end the parking session earlier.

Another useful feature of parking.sg includes the 10-minute alert that the user will receive before the parking session expires. Should there be a need to extend the parking duration, the user can do it remotely via the app.
