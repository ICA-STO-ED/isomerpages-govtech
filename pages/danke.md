Dear friends,

Having been in CMG for several years means I’ve seen many peeps come and go, had good and blah times, had the opportunity to learn and try different things (not talking about pantry snacks or media lunches!) and most importantly met awesome people. These strange times are unfortunate as we don’t get to see each other - so I thought I’d share a few words or things I’ll remember (even though there is more to say and we’ll still catch up!). 


Keng Soon - Guidance and the faith over the years, and introducing Keyaki (feel free to invite if empty chair)
   
Joyce - Chionging the last three months, where we probably worked the most closely together ; and the group hangouts 

Roy - Working on various projects, the little discussions and jokes, and catalysing the creativity in things we do

Veron - A bubbly and clever   

MJ - First ever RO and replenisher of snacks and alcohol, synonymous with events and some say Michael Jackson

Medha - The provider of food for hungry and weary souls, randomness and wise words

Lydia - I don’t remember how “hot mama” came about but that doesn’t matter as much as the good laughs whenever I walked to the CMG pantry 

Cindy - Sorry I did not get a chance to chat often but thanks for the warm hellos

Diana - Worked or helped each other on so many things over the years, the deadpan humour as well as photography and animals 

Boon Leng - The wordsmith and media relations guru whose puns will be missed

Leonard - Funky and easy to talk to person about sports or general topics 

Leon - Always in awe when it comes to his video passion. Hopefully we get the chance to make Sapa a reality one day 

Yi Qian - All the nonsense talks, laughs and 90s music to get through the day. Also the script, filming and animation work!

Ansen - Bringing in the data insights and tools and sending random emails from unlocked computers (Medha please read)  

Stephanie - Cool and calm and when you chat with her more you get to know she’s pretty funny

Tiffany - Fun to talk with and share a chuckle, I think mostly about babies. Eyung will finally be glad to have a meimei working with him instead of a nan ren (same applies to Steven!) 

Lynette - The creative and micro influencer who always has cool and funny things to share 

Jacklyn - Known for ages and having experienced some of the most hilarious and some opposite-of-hilarious things together. Wishing you the best in the next phase! 

Jenny - STACK digital partner-in-crime and someone who has vast experience, and good ideas and sense of humour ; less chance to disturb you doesn’t mean no chance 

Silver - Silver in name but gold in graphic work, arigato for all the visual magic 

Kimmi - A mother figure who never says no when we need, I’m truly grateful for the friendship ever since internship days 

Liz - Quiet at first glance but not so much when I got to know you and we spoke more about things out of work sphere

Raymond - Smart City Expo showcase (PSA: say no even if business class ticket)  and the social media work

Serene - The hilarious exchanges during lunch and when we sat closer with each other

Vasu - Always cheerful and patient if we need anything, you cannot imagine a CMG without Vasu 

Alexa &  Yi Yun - Good luck!
