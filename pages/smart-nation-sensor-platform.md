In becoming a Smart Nation where people live meaningful and fulfilling lives filled with endless opportunities, enabled by technology, citizens and businesses need to be empowered with information that allows them to make more meaningful choices to improve their lives.

Through a shared network of sensors, the Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) will enable agencies to better maximise deployments by collecting and analysing data to make decisions on city planning in a cost-effective way and improve the delivery of citizen-centric public services.

Government agencies will be able to share data collected through the SNSP in 2020 to facilitate better sense-making and improve situational awareness in a cost-effective manner.
