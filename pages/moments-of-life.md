In digitalisation, the importance lies not only in moving processes online but also in unifying multiple touchpoints into one single service journey. This has been achieved through the Moments of Life (MOL) app, which places citizens at the heart of government digital services. It delivers integrated services and information to citizens at key milestones in their lives.

The MOL app was developed based on the insights gathered through citizen engagement sessions to identify and better understand usersâ€™ challenges and needs. Currently, it supports parents with children aged six and below, and seniors above the age of 60, providing personalised information relating to childcare and active ageing respectively.
