As part of the Government Technology Agency’s (“GovTech”) ongoing efforts to ensure the cyber-security of Government internet-accessible applications used by the citizens, business and public sector employees, GovTech has established this suspected vulnerability disclosure programme (“VDP”) to encourage the responsible reporting of suspected vulnerabilities or weaknesses in IT services, systems, resources and/or processes which may potentially affect Government internet-accessible applications. We look forward to working with the cyber-security research community and members of the public to keep our services safe for all users.

For clarity, the VDP does not authorise or permit the taking of any action which may contravene applicable laws and regulations (e.g. Computer Misuse Act). For the avoidance of doubt, attempts to exploit or test suspected vulnerabilities (e.g. gaining unauthorised access to any computer program or data) are prohibited.  

You are expected to conduct yourself responsibly at all times and if you are in any doubt about any proposed course of conduct, please contact us immediately at cybersecurity@tech.gov.sg.

### **What you can do to help**

a.	Act responsibly for the sole purpose of reporting suspected vulnerabilities and safeguarding users from damage, harm or loss.

b.	Avoid causing any kind of damage, harm or loss to individuals or organisations (e.g. you should not attempt to test, reproduce or verify the suspected vulnerability, or take any action which may cause interruption or degradation of PS Services).

c.	Conduct yourself in accordance with applicable laws and regulations at all times. If you have any doubt about such laws or regulations, please seek and obtain professional legal advice. Under no circumstances should you attempt to exfiltrate any computer data or publish details of any suspected vulnerability. 

d.	Upon detection of a suspected vulnerability, notify us immediately or as soon as practicable by submitting a report to us at cybersecurity@tech.gov.sg.  You may encrypt your emails to us using our PGP key:
