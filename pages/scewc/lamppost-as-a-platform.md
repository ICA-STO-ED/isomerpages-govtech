Part of the Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) project, the Lamppost as a Platform (LaaP) aims to maximise the use of Singaporeâ€™s street lampposts. Under the current LaaP trial in two parts of Singapore, lampposts are fitted with a network of wireless sensors and cameras that better support urban planning and operations.
 
The sensors detect and monitor changes to environmental conditions like humidity, rainfall, temperature and pollutants in the air. 
 
The cameras have analytic capabilities to count and analyse crowd build-ups, as well as count, classify and monitor the speed of Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) to enhance safety in public spaces.
