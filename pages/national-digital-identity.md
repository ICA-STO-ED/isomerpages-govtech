With transactions being increasingly digitised, the Singapore Government is developing a National Digital Identity (NDI) platform, an extension from the SingPass authentication system, which provides better convenience and security for citizens when transacting online. The NDI allows citizens a single digital identity to transact with both the public and private sectors.

Essentially, NDI serves as a secure and trusted digital credential, as well as a platform for authentication, authorisation and consent. Moving forward, in 2020, the NDI will also enable private and public sectors to develop value-added services on a common and universal trust framework.

The NDI brings various digital initiatives like the SingPass Mobile, MyInfo and MyInfo Business together to provide greater online convenience and transactional security for citizens and businesses.

The SingPass Mobile application, a cryptographic-based software token, allow its users the option to log in via 2-Factor Authentication (2FA). Users can log in using their fingerprint, facial recognition (for selected smartphones) or a 6-digit password. Users based overseas can use the app to transact with the Singapore Government without the need for a physical token.

MyInfo is a ‘Tell Us Once” service that minimises the need for users to repeatedly provide and verify the same personal information when transacting with the government agencies online. After authentication via SingPass, the user’s basic government verified personal details is stored and will be auto-populated each time he performs a transaction.
