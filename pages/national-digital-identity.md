With transactions being increasingly digitised, the Singapore Government is developing a National Digital Identity (NDI) platform, an extension from the SingPass authentication system, which provides better convenience and security for citizens when transacting online. The NDI allows citizens a single digital identity to transact with both the public and private sectors.

Essentially, NDI serves as a secure and trusted digital credential, as well as a platform for authentication, authorisation and consent. Moving forward, in 2020, the NDI will also enable private and public sectors to develop value-added services on a common and universal trust framework.

The NDI brings various digital initiatives like the SingPass Mobile, MyInfo and MyInfo Business together to provide greater online convenience and transactional security for citizens and businesses.
